# User-Authentication-System
This Python project implements a user authentication system with four main functionalities:

Registration Page: Allows users to register by providing their name, roll number, email, and password.
Login Page: Validates user credentials (roll number and password) for successful login. Displays appropriate messages for incorrect or unregistered users.
Profile Display: Displays user profile information (excluding password) after successful login.
Logout Functionality: Terminates the user session in the system.
This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming and object-oriented design principles. It serves as a simple yet effective example of user authentication implementation in Python.
